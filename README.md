# MESLAS: Multivariate Excursion Set Learning by Adaptive Sampling

The MESLAS package provides functionalities for simulation of multivariate
gaussian random fields, as well as adaptive sampling startegies to learn
excursion sets thereof.

It originated as part of a collaboration between NTNU Trondheim and University
of Bern that aimed at developing methods for identification of excursion sets
of vector-valued random fields for applications in autonomous ocean sampling.

The package documentation and more details may be found on the [Project Website](https://cedrictravelletti.github.io/MESLAS/).


The authors of the package gratefully acknowledge funding from the **Swiss National Science Fundation
(SNF)** through project no. 178858.
